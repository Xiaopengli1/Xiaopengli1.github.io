## Introduction

I am **Xiaopeng Li**, currently a 2nd-year Ph.D. student at City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof. Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/) in [AML Lab](https://aml-cityu.github.io/). Before that, I received M.S. and B.Eng degrees from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2022 and 2019.  

I am broadly interested in Data Mining and Machine Learning. My current research interests and outputs are summarized in several topics:
1. **Multi-Domain Recommendation**
    * Papers - [HAMUR](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3583780.3615137), [D3](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/28699), [HierRec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02061)
    * Benchmark - [Scenario-Wise Rec](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17374)
    * Tutorial - [Joint Modeling in Deep Recommender Systems]() (WWW'2025)
2. **LLMs for Information Retrieval**
    * Papers - [Agent4Ranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15450), [Syneg](), [MILL](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-long.138.pdf)
3. **LLMs Reasoning & Multi-Modal LLMs**
    * Papers - [TAPO](), [G3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14702)
4. **Personalized RAG**
